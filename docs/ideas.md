# Ideas

## Concepts

- Killing enemies has consequences because it makes the game harder (they explode into many projectiles)
- Killing "enemies" has consequences on the story
- You are constantly faced with dilemmas which have lasting consequences (like losing some abilities)
- Your lives are your attacks, each shot has consequences

## Unit commander

It's a mix of unit management and bullet hell, and a roguelike. You play as the commander in the military (the magic kind) and you must fight the forces of evil or something. You send units as squads to fight or to run errands (shopping, investigating, etc). If someone dies for any reason, they're gone forever (unless expensive resurrection or something).

Units are grouped into squads. Squads stick together during combats etc. You can send multiple squads into one combat, but you'll have to manage both of them, which is harder. Squads can be changed between combats/events, but you can only change squads in the same groups (more consequences!)

During combats, you control units with the mouse (and optionally keyboard). The projectiles are not as fast paced as something like Touhou, but instead focus on strategy (sending your tank into the danger zone while your damagers take down the enemy from behind for example). However, dodging bullet patterns instead of using skills to block them can save important resources.

Units can be recruited outside of combats (could be after combat, in towns, in events etc.). Each unit is more power but also more people to worry about and more importantly more mouths to feed! Less units will leave you with less opportunities to explore and get stronger however.

When a unit fights, they level up (only 5 levels or something), meaning units that you've had for longer are desirable for harder fights, but also are more painful to lose. units have health points but they are all low, the game is not about calculating HP (we can even use a vague HP display that doesn't tell exactly how much they have). They also have skill points to use skills in or outside of combat.
